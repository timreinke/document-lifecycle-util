# Overview
      
This debouncer is used to debounce document writes. This helps in
implementing autosave functionality. Your application can send every
update through to the persistence layer and the persistence layer will
flush only so often.

The application may want to indicate to the user when their changes are
fully flushed or if there is a failure (e.g. a network disconnection).
In order for the application to provide this feedback to the user, it
will want to observe certain facts about the state of persistence:
whether the write buffer is flushed and if there is an error what that
error is.

Additionally, the flush process is asynchronous, so we may receive
further write requests during flushing.
